My first experience with computers was watching my oldest brother rig up a baud modem to our brand new Windows 1995 computer and play Warcraft II with his friend across town.
The resulting thousand-dollar internet bill and my parents anger at my brother taught me nothing - I've been hooked on computers ever since.

I currently work as a Web Application Developer for Polk County in Des Moines and have been since 2016. I utilize the .NET stack to create web applications that help Polk County better serve its residents.
