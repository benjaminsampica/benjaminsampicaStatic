I currently work as a Web Application Developer for Polk County in Des Moines and have been since 2016.

I utilize the .NET stack to create web applications that help Polk County better serve its residents.

I graduated from the University of Northern Iowa with a bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems in May of 2016. I
also graduated in 2012 with a associate's degree as a Computer Support Specialist.
